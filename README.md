# Arachne

The idea is to have a simple semi-static framework for writing web-pages.

## Goals

- To be very simple: everything have to be encoded in a single well documented file.
- To support safe internal references: guranteed no broken internal references.
- Sane defaults; which should get you started quick.

## Reach Goals

- Be able to serve non-static sites.
